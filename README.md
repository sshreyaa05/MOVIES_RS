### Movie Recommendation System Using Correlation for Star Wars and Liar Liar

### Project Overview:
The objective of this project was to build a movie recommendation system using a correlation-based approach. After performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study the dataset, we implemented a recommendation system to suggest similar movies. The system specifically provided recommendations for movies like Star Wars and Liar Liar.

### Steps Performed:

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

1. Obtained a movie ratings dataset containing user ratings for various movies.

2. Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.

3. Formed a user-item matrix for further analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. Visualized the distribution of movie ratings and identified popular movies.

2. Analyzed user behavior patterns and detected rating biases.

3. Created histograms and scatter plots to observe trends in ratings.

#### Correlation-Based Recommendation:

1. Created a pivot table of movies with user ratings.

2. Calculated the correlation between movies based on user rating similarities.

3. Applied filtering to ensure accurate recommendations by considering movies with a sufficient number of ratings.

#### Movie Recommendation for Star Wars and Liar Liar:

1. Focused on generating recommendations for the movies Star Wars and Liar Liar.

2. Found movies with the highest correlation scores to each of these.

3. Displayed top recommendations based on correlation values.

#### Evaluation:

1. Verified the recommendations to ensure they were relevant and logical.

2. Compared the results with general user preferences to validate accuracy.

### Results:

1. The system successfully provided accurate movie recommendations based on correlation analysis.

2. For Star Wars, the recommendations included other sci-fi and action movies preferred by similar users.
